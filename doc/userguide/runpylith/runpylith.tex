\section{Organization of Simulation Components}

The components in a PyLith simulation generally fall into four main
categories:
\begin{description}
\item[Topology] Components associated with the spatial discretization
  of the domain, such as the finite-element mesh;
\item[Physics] Components specifying the physics to be solved, such as
  materials associated with a governing equation, bulk rheologies,
  boundary conditions, and fault interface conditions;
\item[Physics Implementation] Components that perform the
  finite-element operations, such as integration of the residual and
  system Jacobian; and
\item[Observers] Components that get notified of updates to the
  solution and state variables, such as writers for saving the
  solution to a file.
\end{description}
The physics components provide the point-wise functions (kernels) used
by the physics implementation components, the auxiliary field, and the
layout of the derived field (subfields computed from the auxiliary
field and solution, such as stress and strain).

Figure \vref{fig:pylith:workflow} shows the workflow for running PyLith.
The user supplies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mesh information. This includes the topology of the
  finite-element mesh (coordinates of vertices and how the vertices
  are connected into cells), a material identifier for each cell, and
  sets of vertices associated with boundary conditions, faults, and
  output (for subsets of the mesh). This information can be provided
  using the PyLith mesh ASCII format (see Chapter \vref{cha:examples}
  for examples and Section \vref{sec:format:MeshIOAscii} for the format
  specification) or by importing the information from the LaGriT or
  CUBIT meshing packages (see Chapter \vref{cha:examples} for
  examples).
\item A set of parameters describing the problem. These parameters
  describe the type of problem to be run, solver information,
  time-stepping information, boundary conditions, materials, etc. This
  information can be provided from the command-line or by using a
  \filename{cfg} file.
\item Spatial databases specifying the values for the material
  properties and boundary conditions. Arbitrarily complex spatial
  variations in boundary and fault conditions and material properties
  may be given in the spatial database (see Chapter
  \vref{cha:examples} for examples and Appendix
  \vref{sec:format:SimpleIOAscii} for the format specification).
\end{enumerate}
PyLith writes solution information, such as solution fields and state
variables, to either VTK files or HDF5/Xdmf files using the observer
components. ParaView and Visit can read both types of
files. Post-processing of output is generally performed using HDF5
files accessed via a Python script and the h5py package or a Matlab
script.

  \caption{PyLith requires a finite-element mesh (three different
    mechanisms for generating a mesh are currently supported),
    simulation parameters, and spatial databases (defining the spatial
    variation of various parameters).  PyLith writes the solution
    output to either VTK or HDF5/Xdmf files, which can be visualized
    with ParaView or Visit. Post-processing is generally done using
    the HDF5 files with Python or Matlab scripts.}
